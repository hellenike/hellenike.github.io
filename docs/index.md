# Hellênikê: an introductory course in ancient Greek

> Encounter a historical language and culture, and engage with how that language and culture continue to shape structures of power today.


## Overview

Hellênikê is an open-source introduction to ancient Greek. It emphasizes:

- engagement with authentic texts from the first day of the course
- connecting the experience of reading ancient Greek to students' lived experience
- a corpus-linguistic understanding of "Greek" as the language attested in a specified corpus
- pedagogy informed by contemporary research in language learning


## Status


Hellênikê is in early planning stages.  We expect to publish early versions of our course material here in 2021 and 2022, and hope to pilot a full-year course using Hellênikê at Holy Cross in 2022-2023.
